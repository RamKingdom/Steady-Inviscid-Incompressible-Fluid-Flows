# Steady-Inviscid-Incompressible-Fluid-Flows
This project is about computing streamline patterns for Steady  Inviscid Incompressible Fluid Flows through chamber.

# Follow the following precedure to execute the program
1. The file format is .py
2. Install the numpy library and matplotlib library in your python interpreter(VS Code) before running it.
3. Load  the python file in the interpreter and run it. Select run without debugging option and then select python debugger.
4  You can also just double click it, which will open the python file in Vs code. Run  the file by selecting  run without debugging option and then select python debugger.
5. In case of  Google collab , copy and paste the code and then run it.
6. The code will generate a total of 19 plots, 9 for streamline pattern, 9 for vwlocity field streamplot and 1 for convergence (all in one)   for each case for a given initial gues     and boundary condition.
6. The code will generate the error and no. of iterations taken for convergence for each case.
